Beginning the Beginner's series:
The video below describes the general structure and objective of the series and allowed me to know what to expect as I learned JavaScript step by step. It made clear the way in which every topic is related and flows through the course.
                                    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Is JavaScript:
This lesson gave an introduction to JavaScript and its functionality and application in adding interactivity to websites. It made me understand the reasons why JavaScript is a fundamental technology in a contemporary web development.
                                    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Populating Arrays:
This video informed me about how to add values into arrays and how to access them by index values. It provided me with an empirical idea of how arrays process and store various data.
                                   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions:
This lesson was on functions and how they enable making the code reusable by factions of instructions that are grouped into named sections. I got to know the importance of functions in writing clean, efficient and maintainable code.
                                   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript object notation (JavaScript Object Notation):
This episode presented the concept of JSON which is a lightweight and structured system of data storage and transfer. This was particularly helpful to me, as it is a common API and data communication use.
                                   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Demo: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON):
The demonstration simplified JSON by demonstrating actual example of object write and access. The examples of real applications were useful to support my perception of the concept.
                                  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package Management:
This video described the way package managers are utilized to install and administer third-party libraries. It demonstrated to me how contemporary development can tend to rely on tools shared rather than make all of them on its own.
